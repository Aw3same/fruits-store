# fruits-store

This repo contains a tecnic test for the Katoo DEV team.
## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Project structure

We have 3 pages:
- Products.
- About.
- Cart.

Reusable components:
- Products: for all products in the app.
- Counter: used to select the amount of fruits in the store.
- Navbar: used to navigate thought the application.

I used a store to:

- Save the products, and action on them
- Manage the Cart.
- Store the voucher codes.

## Future improvements

- Improve styles of all applications.
- Refactor the Cart component, simplifiying the way I manage the user experience.
- Add toast notifications instead of javascript alerts.
- Allow the user to remove items from the Cart.

And many many more...
